# MINI-PROJECT-4-SEM-
# DETECTING OFFENSIVE CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA
The idea of this project is to analyze a twitter dataset and use it to train a Machine Learning model which can then use that model to predict weather the text or tweet is Offensive or Not.

## STEPS
1>Loading dataset
-> train1.csv
-> test1.csv(for testing the model only)

2>Inspect

3>cleaning and transform

4>visualizing the dataset (Using Python tools like matplotlib, wordcloud modules to visuialize our data.)

5>model the data for training the Machine Learning Model to predict whether the content is Offensive or Not.
